# ClearDOTA
ClearDOTA is an application designed to assist players to focus more on game by providing real-time information about **Rune spawns**, **Roshan timers**, and **Roshan's inventory** and **allied buybacks**. It also uses **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** functionality to deliver notifications audibly, ensuring players never miss critical game events.
